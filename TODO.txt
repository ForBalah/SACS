BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION FILE
===============================
Sandcastle Help File Builder is used to generate the documetation for SACS.Implementation. The .shfbproj file resides in the 
SolutionItems folder.

If any changes are made to the SACS implementation file, the documentation should be rebuild (manually, using the help file 
builder) and copied into the setup folder.

To build the documentation:
- Download and install Sandcastle Help File Builder: https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB.
- Open the sacs.implementation.shfbproj file with the program.
- Remove and re-add the SACS.Implementation.dll and SACS.Implementation.xml files on the right. It looks like the location
  of the files is not relative so you may get an error "cannot find sources" even though the source files are clearly 
  visible in the list.
- Build the project - this will generate the help file. Replace the .chm file in the SACS.Setup/lib folder.

ISSUES
======

General Issues
--------------
I think the scheduler is killing timers and not renewing them when it should. 
Might be related to services crashing during execution, and then the timer is null, therefore the server crashes on stop.
Check the SchedulingService timers to see under what situations it could be possible that the timers don't reinitialize.

Presentation Layer - Windows:
-----------------------------
Add Help
Fix disabling of toolbar buttons when the service is inaccessible.
Configure log4net properly in presentation layer (Elmah maybe?)
Log detail - Update the column headers
Redirect metrics to different analytics app
Fix SACS version column
Implmement IoC
Disable the stop server button when it has been clicked (at least for 10 seconds or until the service has stopped)
Disable the start service app button when it has been clicked
Add button to open app location
Add an About section
Add Last Run column
Make hitting "refresh" on any button in the server will just refresh everything

Presentation Layer - Web:
-------------------------
Configure elmah in web project
Redirect metrics to different analytics app
Setup profiler - either MiniProfiler or Glimpse.
Fix SACS version column
Implmement IoC
Add Last Run column

Business Layer:
---------------
put log debug all over the place

Service layer:
--------------
put log debug all over the place
Send alert if CPU usage remains high for too long?
Create more useful error messages when the agent fails to start

Data Access Layer:
------------------
Move DAO creation to IoC

Server:
-------
put log debug all over the place
Implmement IoC
Create Wizard:
- Install service as user
- (optional) Install web (or use a different installer)

Issues to address:
-

Configuration:
--------------
Set the username in log4net if an exception occurs within a service

Implementation
--------------
specify that command is invalid if nothing processes it.
