BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION FILE
===============================
Sandcastle Help File Builder is used to generate the documetation for SACS.Implementation. The .shfbproj file resides in the 
SolutionItems folder.

If any changes are made to the SACS implementation file, the documentation should be rebuilt (manually, using the help file 
builder) and copied into the setup folder.

To build the documentation:
- Download and install Sandcastle Help File Builder: https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB.
- Open the sacs.implementation.shfbproj file with the GUI.
- Remove and re-add the SACS.Implementation.dll and SACS.Implementation.xml files on the right. It looks like the location
  of the files is not relative so you may get an error "cannot find sources" even though the source files are clearly 
  visible in the list.
- Build the project - this will generate the help file and will place it in a 'Help' subfolder in SolutionItems.
- Replace the .chm file in the SACS.Setup/lib folder.

FIRST BUILD ISSUES ON WINDOWS 10
================================
The Certificate needs to be installed on the target PC before the solution will build.

To fix it, open the command prompt and enter the following:
sn -i "[Location of pfx file in the porject]" [Name of key container name in error message]

e.g.
sn -i "C:\Development\Projects\SACS\Libraries\SACS.Common\SACS.Security.Certificate.pfx" VS_KEY_3A18F820AE4E3836
